Metadata-Version: 2.1
Name: diazo
Version: 1.5.0
Summary: Diazo implements a Deliverance like language using a pure
        XSLT engine. With Diazo, you "compile" your theme and ruleset in one
        step, then use a superfast/simple transform on each request thereafter.
        Alternatively, compile your theme during development, check it into
        version control, and not touch Diazo during deployment.

==============================================
Diazo - We Write XSLT, So You Don't Have To
==============================================

Diazo allows you to apply a theme contained in a static HTML web page to a
dynamic website created using any server-side technology. With Diazo, you can
take an HTML wireframe created by a web designer and turn it into a theme for
your favourite CMS, redesign the user interface of a legacy web application
without even having access to the original source code, or build a unified
user experience across multiple disparate systems, all in a matter of hours,
not weeks.

When using Diazo, you will work with syntax and concepts familiar from working
with HTML and CSS. And by allowing you seamlessly integrate XSLT into your
rule files, Diazo makes common cases simple and complex requirements possible.

For detailed documentation, please see diazo.org_.

------------------

* Python 3 support.
  [regebro, elro]


1.0.6 (2014-09-11)
------------------

* Use formencode's xml_compare method to compare test results. This solves test
  failures on several systems.
  [timo]

* Also evaluate if-not-content. However, we are at risk of replicating
  apply-conditions.xsl in it's entirety. this needs refactoring.
  [lentinj]

* Remove any xml:lang attribute from content to prevent multiple
  xml:lang attributes when the html tag's attributes are copied.
  [danjacka]

1.0.5 (2014-01-27)
------------------

* Escape curly brackets on theme attributes.
  [TracyWebTech]

1.0.4 (2013-08-14)
------------------

* Provide the request's query string as the ``$query_string`` variable
  for use in the rules file.
  [davidjb]

* Fix ``diazo.scheme`` definition to be correct. Previously, this was
  defined as ``request.host``.
  [davidjb]

1.0.3 (2012-11-11)
------------------

* Support selectors matching multiple elements for merge attributes, e.g.
  ``<merge attributes="class" css:theme="body" css:content="#one, #two"/>``
  [elro]

* Also evaluate merged-condition. This means a rule tag will turn red
  when a condition on an outer rules tag doesn't match.
  [lentinj]

* use boolean(), not count() for if-content. Otherwise we
  generate expressions like "count(nodeset and other_nodeset)",
  which aren't valid.
  [lentinj]

* Output contents of error log as part of debugging output
  [lentinj]

* Debugging output.
  [lentinj]

* Don't close the response unless Diazo is transforming it.

  [djay]

1.0.2 (2012-08-30)
------------------

* Handle error when serializing empty responses by returning an unthemed
  response. Previously, empty text/html responses resulted in an raised
  exception, resulting in a 500 response and no output.
  [davidjb]

* Allow attributes (i.e. xml:id) to pass through on drop @attribute nodes
  [lentinj]

1.0.1 (2012-05-09)
------------------

* Fixed to not apply absolute prefix for relative urls starting with '#'.
  [datakurre]

1.0 (2012-04-15)
----------------

* Preserve resolvers in the rules document when updating from an old namespace.

* Add javascript / css include support to WSGIResolver.

* Refactoring if WSGI middleware to use WebOb better and fix corner cases.
