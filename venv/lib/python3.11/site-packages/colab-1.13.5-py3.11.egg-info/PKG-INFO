* Changes to the trac system code.

* Discussions at the mailman list.

* And other systems in the community.

Installation
============

First install the dependencies and than the project it self:

.. code-block::

  pip install -e .

Development environment
-----------------------

You must install vagrant to set up the development environment. With vagrant available you should run:

.. code-block::

  vagrant up

During the process you should choose the vagrant box that you want to use. In the end you should have a virtual machine with development environment set up.



Running Colab
=============

To run Colab with development server you will have to:

1- Log in virtual machine:

.. code-block::

  vagrant ssh
  
2- Use colab virtualenv:

.. code-block::

  workon colab
  
3- Run the development server: 

.. code-block::

  colab-admin runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

Now you can access colab in your browser via http://localhost:8000

**NOTE**: In case you want to keep the configuration file else where just set the 
desired location in environment variable **COLAB_SETTINGS**.
